# ROM‑R Public Benchmarks

This repository hosts reproducible benchmarks on publicly available datasets to demonstrate my experimental methodology. Each script is intentionally simplified and uses open‑source datasets such as CIFAR, Tiny ImageNet, and MNIST.

## Content

- **`benchmarks/`** — experiment scripts for CIFAR, Tiny ImageNet, and MNIST. These scripts are deliberately minimal, focusing on reproducibility rather than performance.
- **`configs/`** — placeholder configuration files you can adapt for your own runs.
- **`results/`** — example logs and CSVs illustrating how to analyze runs.
- **`plots/`** — scripts to generate basic plots from benchmark results.

## Purpose

These benchmarks show how to structure experiments and stress tests using the scaffolding defined in the `romr‑methodology` repository. They do **not** include any proprietary formulas or thresholds. For advanced features like residual‑collapse detection and recursive modeling triggers, please see my private repository or contact me directly.
